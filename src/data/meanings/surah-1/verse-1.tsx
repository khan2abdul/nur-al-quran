    // Simple English explanation (5th-grade level)
    meaningEn: `This verse is like saying "I start with Allah's name." Just like when you start your homework by writing your name at the top, Muslims start everything important by remembering Allah. It's a way of asking for Allah's help and blessings.

Example: When you say "Bismillah" before eating, you're thanking Allah for the food and asking Him to make it good for you.

Think about it: What are some things you do every day that you could start with "Bismillah"?`,

    // Hinglish explanation (relatable to Indian context)
    meaningHi: `Yeh verse kehta hai "Allah ke naam se shuru karta hoon." Jaise tum exam mein apna naam likhte ho, waise hi Muslims har important kaam Allah ka naam lekar shuru karte hain. Yeh Allah se help maangne ka tarika hai.

Example: Jab tum khana khane se pehle "Bismillah" bolte ho, toh tum Allah ko thank kar rahe ho aur usse dua kar rahe ho ki khana tumhare liye acha ho.

Socho to sahi: Tum har din kaunse kaam karte ho jinhe "Bismillah" bolkar shuru kar sakte ho?`,
